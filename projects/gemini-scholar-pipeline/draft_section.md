Moltmann’s Integration of the Zimzum Doctrine
Theological Definition and Purpose
Jürgen Moltmann explicitly correlates the concept of Zimzum—and therefore kenosis—with the Christian concept of original creation (Source: [fbc9189d]). He utilizes this cabalistic doctrine of zimzum (contraction) primarily to clarify the theological meaning of creation for God (Source: [ebcf0275]).

Drawing from Jewish mysticism, Moltmann discusses zimzum as a doctrine concerning God's self-limitation during creation (Source: [6512fed4]). This involves the notion of God’s primordial self-restriction or self-withdrawal (Source: [b01097bd]). Specifically, it posits that God restricts divine presence to create a primordial empty space (Source: [a72455ec]).

Significance for Creatio Ex Nihilo
Moltmann positions this concept as pivotal to understanding creation theology. He describes zimzum as the only serious attempt to think through creatio ex nihilo in a truly theological way (Source: [b01097bd]). By employing this concept of divine contraction, Moltmann presents a theology that brings God down to the level of the world (Source: [9dea3e6b]).

Spatial Implications and the Newton-Leibniz Debate
Beyond the act of creation itself, Moltmann applies zimzum to address complex metaphysical problems regarding the nature of space:

Resolving Historical Debates: Moltmann uses the zimzum metaphor as a solution to the historical debate between Isaac Newton and Leibniz concerning space (Source: [ebcf0275]).

differentiation of Space: His use of Zimzum allows for the differentiation of three kinds of space, which includes the absolute space of God (Source: [d9a9e47c]).

Eschatological Balance
Moltmann does not view zimzum in isolation. He balances God’s primordial self-withdrawal (Zimzum) with the eschatological notion of aevum (relative eternity), linking the protological act of contraction with an eschatological framework (Source: [dfbdc222]).

Would you like me to expand on the comparison between Newton and Leibniz regarding space to further contextualize Moltmann's solution?
