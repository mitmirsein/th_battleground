## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου (Toūto estin to sōma mou):** The copulative verb *estin* ("is") is the central grammatical and theological pivot. Its semantic range allows for interpretations from identity ("this is identical to my body") to representation ("this signifies my body"), forming the linguistic basis for centuries of theological debate.
- **ἀνάμνησις (anamnēsis):** This term, translated "remembrance," is not a simple psychological recall. In the Septuagint (LXX) and broader Hellenistic context, it denotes a memorial that makes a past reality present and effective. It is an action-oriented, liturgical term.
- **κοινωνία (koinonia):** Translated as "participation," "fellowship," or "sharing." In 1 Corinthians 10:16, its use with the genitive case ("participation *in* the blood/body") denotes a profound, real sharing in the very object itself, not merely a shared experience about the object.
- **τρώγω (trōgō) vs. ἐσθίω (esthiō):** In John 6, the shift from the general verb for "to eat" (*esthiō*) to the more graphic, physical verb *trōgō* (to gnaw, chew) in the latter part of the discourse (e.g., 6:54) signifies a deliberate intensification of the realism of "eating" Jesus's flesh.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Core Arguments
A precise lexical analysis of the Greek terms in the Eucharistic passages reveals a semantic depth that fueled, and continues to inform, major theological positions. The language chosen by the NT authors is consistently weighted towards realism and participation, rather than mere symbolism.

### Key Textual Evidence (Original Language Analysis)

1.  **The Verb "Is" (ἐστιν, *estin*)**
    -   **Lexical Range:** In Koine Greek, as in English, the verb "to be" can function in several ways:
        -   **Identity:** A = B (e.g., "The Lord is God").
        -   **Attribute:** A has the quality of B (e.g., "God is love").
        -   **Representation/Symbolism:** A stands for B (e.g., "The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches," Rev 1:20).
    -   **Contextual Usage:** In the context of the Last Supper, which is steeped in the realism of the Jewish Passover meal, a purely symbolic meaning is unlikely to have been the primary sense. The Passover lamb *was* the sacrifice, not just a picture of it. The debate hinges on whether *estin* points to a metaphysical reality (Catholic/Orthodox/Lutheran view) or a symbolic-spiritual reality (Reformed/Zwinglian view). The use of *estin* in other biblical contexts for symbolic meaning (as in Revelation) provides the linguistic warrant for non-literal interpretations, but the covenantal context of the Last Supper pushes towards a more realist reading.

2.  **Remembrance (ἀνάμνησις, *anamnēsis*)**
    -   **Lexical Range:** Found in Luke 22:19 and 1 Cor 11:24-25. In classical Greek, it means "recall." However, its biblical usage is shaped by the LXX. In Numbers 10:10, the trumpet blasts over sacrifices serve as an *anamnēsis* "before your God." It is a memorial that brings the worshipper and their covenant status to God's mind.
    -   **Contextual Usage:** Therefore, "Do this for my *anamnēsis*" is not just "Remember me when you do this." It is a command to perform a liturgical act that makes the sacrifice of Christ a present and effective reality for the community and brings the community before God under the sign of that sacrifice.

3.  **Participation (κοινωνία, *koinonia*)**
    -   **Lexical Range:** This is a core Pauline term for the shared life of the Christian community. It is not passive. It denotes active partnership and sharing *in* something.
    -   **Contextual Usage:** In 1 Cor 10:16, the phrasing is critical: "κοινωνία τοῦ αἵματος/σώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ" (*koinonia tou haimatos/sōmatos tou Christou*). This is a genitive of participation. Believers are not just sharing a meal *with* each other; they are collectively sharing *in* the blood and body of Christ. This language strongly resists a purely memorialist or symbolic interpretation, as it points to the elements as the locus of this participation.

4.  **Eating (τρώγω, *trōgō*)**
    -   **Lexical Range:** While *esthiō* is the common, neutral term for eating, *trōgō* is more graphic. It is used for animals eating and carries a sense of audible chewing or gnawing.
    -   **Contextual Usage:** In John 6:54-58, Jesus shifts from *esthiō* to *trōgō*. This linguistic choice appears to be a deliberate response to the crowd's disbelief (v. 52). Instead of softening his language, Jesus intensifies the realism of his call to partake of his flesh and blood. This intensification supports a reading of the discourse that points towards a real, not merely metaphorical, reception of Christ, which has strong Eucharistic implications.

## CONTESTED POINTS & LIMITATIONS
- **Aramaic Background:** Jesus almost certainly spoke Aramaic, not Greek, at the Last Supper. The Greek *estin* is a translation of a likely unstated Aramaic copula. Some scholars argue that in Aramaic, the phrase "this [is] my body" would more naturally mean "this signifies my body." However, this is an argument from reconstruction and cannot be definitively proven. We must analyze the meaning conveyed by the Greek texts as we have them.
- **Semantic Ambiguity:** While the analysis points towards a realist interpretation, the inherent flexibility of language means that definitive "proof" for one specific theological doctrine (e.g., Transubstantiation) from the Greek text alone is impossible. The lexical data provides a framework, but theological conclusions require integrating this data with broader biblical and traditional contexts.

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: High
**Rationale:** The lexical and grammatical data of the Greek New Testament is stable and well-documented. While interpretation of this data is the basis of debate, the semantic ranges and contextual usages of the key terms are a matter of broad scholarly consensus. The analysis provided is based on standard, universally accepted lexicographical resources.
