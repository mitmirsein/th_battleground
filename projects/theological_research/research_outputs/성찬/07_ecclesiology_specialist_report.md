## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Constitutive of the Church:** The Eucharist is not merely an activity performed *by* the Church, but is fundamentally constitutive of the Church's very being, forming and sustaining the community as the Body of Christ.
- **Koinonia (Communion):** It is the preeminent expression and means of *koinonia*—both vertical communion with Christ, the Head, and horizontal communion among believers, the members, thereby manifesting the Church's unity.
- **Visible Manifestation:** The celebration of the Eucharist makes the invisible reality of the Church (the Body of Christ) visibly manifest in a particular time and place, gathering believers into a tangible community.
- **"Source and Summit":** In Catholic theology, particularly reaffirmed by Vatican II, the Eucharist is considered the "source and summit" (*fons et culmen*) of the Christian life and the Church's activity, from which all other sacraments and ministries flow and to which they are directed.
- **Ecumenical Implications:** Differing Eucharistic ecclesiologies, particularly concerning the nature of presence, sacrifice, and ministry, remain a significant barrier to full visible unity and intercommunion among Christian denominations.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Core Arguments

The ecclesiological significance of the Eucharist stems from its profound connection to the Body of Christ. The sacrament both signifies and effects the Church's identity as the gathered people of God, united in Christ.

**1. Pauline Foundations: The Eucharist as the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 10:16-17; 12:12-13)**
-   Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians is foundational. He explicitly links the partaking of the "one bread" to the formation of the "one body": "Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread" (1 Cor 10:17). This text establishes the Eucharist as the primary means by which believers are incorporated into and sustained as the Body of Christ, the Church.
-   The Eucharist is thus a visible sign of the Church's unity, but also a judgment on its disunity. Paul's condemnation of divisions at the Lord's Supper (1 Cor 11) underscores that a fractured community cannot truly celebrate the sacrament of unity.

**2. Patristic Understanding: *Sacramentum Unitatis***
-   **Augustine of Hippo:** Augustine famously called the Eucharist the *sacramentum unitatis* (sacrament of unity). He taught that when believers receive the Body of Christ, they are simultaneously receiving and becoming the Body of Christ, the Church. "Be what you see, and receive what you are" (*Sermon 272*). For Augustine, the Eucharist is the visible sign of the invisible reality of the Church's unity in Christ.
-   **Cyprian of Carthage:** Cyprian emphasized the Eucharist as the central act of unity around the bishop, who presides over the local church. The unity of the bread and wine in the sacrament symbolized the unity of the faithful gathered around their bishop.

**3. Medieval Developments: Obscuring the Communal**
-   While the doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ remained, the medieval emphasis on individual piety, the rise of private masses, and the decline in lay communion (often reduced to annual reception) tended to obscure the communal and ecclesiological dimensions of the Eucharist. The focus shifted more towards the individual's adoration of Christ's presence and the priest's sacrificial role.

**4. Reformation Perspectives: Re-emphasizing the Community**
-   **Luther:** While focused on the Real Presence, Luther also saw the Eucharist as a communal meal that builds up the congregation, fostering fellowship and mutual support among believers.
-   **Calvin:** Calvin stressed the Eucharist as a bond of unity among believers, a visible sign of their common faith and participation in Christ. It is a means by which the Church is gathered and strengthened.
-   **Zwingli:** For Zwingli, the Eucharist was a public confession of faith and a sign of allegiance to the Christian community, emphasizing the horizontal dimension of fellowship.

**5. Modern Catholic Ecclesiology: Vatican II's Reaffirmation**
-   The Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) profoundly re-emphasized the ecclesiological centrality of the Eucharist.
    -   *Lumen Gentium* (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church) states that the Eucharist is "the source and summit of the whole Christian life" (LG 11).
    -   *Sacrosanctum Concilium* (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy) called for "full, conscious, and active participation" of the faithful in the liturgy, particularly the Eucharist, as the primary means by which the Church expresses and builds itself up. The Eucharist is seen as the primary means by which the Church is built up and made visible.

**6. Ecumenical Dialogue: Barriers to Unity**
-   The Eucharist remains a central, yet often divisive, topic in ecumenical discussions. Differences in understanding the Real Presence, the sacrificial nature of the Eucharist, and the nature of ordained ministry (priesthood/presidency) directly impact the possibility of intercommunion.
-   The World Council of Churches' *Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry* (BEM) document (1982) achieved significant convergence on the ecclesiological implications, affirming the Eucharist as a sign of the Church's unity, a meal of the Kingdom, and a call to mission. However, full agreement on the conditions for intercommunion has not yet been reached.

## CROSS-TRADITION PERSPECTIVES

| Tradition | Ecclesiological Role of Eucharist | Key Emphasis | Implications for Unity/Intercommunion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roman Catholic** | **Constitutive & Unifying:** The Eucharist makes the Church; it is the visible manifestation of the Church's unity. | "Source and summit" of Christian life; requires full ecclesial communion. | Closed communion; intercommunion requires full doctrinal and ministerial unity. |
| **Eastern Orthodox** | **Manifestation of the Church:** The Divine Liturgy (Eucharist) is the manifestation of the Church as the Body of Christ. | The local church gathered around its bishop is the full manifestation of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. | Closed communion; requires full doctrinal and canonical unity. |
| **Lutheran** | **Means of Grace & Community Building:** The Eucharist gathers and strengthens the congregation as the Body of Christ. | Emphasizes the communal aspect and the proclamation of the Gospel. | Generally closed communion, but some allow for "Eucharistic hospitality" under specific conditions. |
| **Reformed** | **Sign & Seal of Unity:** The Eucharist visibly represents and confirms the unity of believers in Christ. | Emphasizes the spiritual bond of believers and their common confession of faith. | Often open communion to all baptized believers who confess Christ. |

## CONTESTED POINTS & LIMITATIONS
- **Eucharistic Hospitality/Intercommunion:** The question of whether Christians from different denominations can share the Eucharist is a major practical and theological challenge. It forces a confrontation with differing ecclesiologies and understandings of what constitutes "the Church."
- **Ministerial Priesthood:** The role of the ordained minister in presiding over the Eucharist is deeply tied to ecclesiology. Catholic and Orthodox traditions see the priest as essential for the validity of the sacrament, reflecting their understanding of apostolic succession and the nature of the Church. Many Protestant traditions emphasize the priesthood of all believers, viewing the minister as a representative of the congregation.
- **The "Real" Church:** Debates over the Eucharist often implicitly or explicitly involve questions about where the "true" Church is to be found, or which community most fully embodies the Body of Christ.

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: High
**Rationale:** The ecclesiological dimensions of the Eucharist are well-articulated across major Christian traditions, with foundational texts from the New Testament and the Church Fathers. Modern ecumenical dialogue has further clarified both points of convergence and divergence, providing a robust framework for analysis.
